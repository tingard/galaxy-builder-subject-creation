# Galaxy-builder subject creation
Helper scripts for subject creation for galaxy builder

`createSubjects.py` Requires [SDSS_cutoutGrab](https://github.com/tingard/SDSS_cutoutGrab) as an installed module.
Also requires:
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
- PIL
- Astropy
- sep (source extractor python)

The jupyter notebooks require data tables which I have not added to GitHub.
